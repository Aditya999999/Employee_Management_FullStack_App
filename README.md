A simple application with Java springboot for backend, ReactJS for frontend and mysql8 for database.
Micrometer is a dimensional-first metrics collection facade whose aim is to allow you to time, count, and gauge your code with a vendor neutral API.
Micrometer will autoconfigure a few metrics which are native to springboot.
This application is using micrometer-shim bridge library to capture and push metrics data to Newrelic.
